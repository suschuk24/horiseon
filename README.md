## Description

Welcome to my first project! My assignment was to re-work existing code for improved SEO and accessibility using html and css. I initially skimmed through the html, looking for any obvious redundancies. From there, I saw the code was  using generic divs instead of the smrt div functionality. After cleaning that up, I did the same thing in css. After cleaning up all redundant files, I re-classed all css attributes to match mock-up spec. Also added privacy page link (currently linked back to index.html) pre-emptively for future additions

## Below are my screenshots of the webpage

## User Story
* AS A marketing agency
* I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
* SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

## Acceptance Criteria
* GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
* WHEN I view the source code
* THEN I find semantic HTML elements
* WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
* THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
* WHEN I view the image elements
* THEN I find accessible alt attributes
* WHEN I view the heading attributes
* THEN they fall in sequential order
* WHEN I view the title element
* THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
