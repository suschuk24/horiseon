# horiseon README Notes:
# welcome to my first project! my assignment was to re-work existing code for improved SEO and accessibility using html and css. I initially skimmed through the html, looking for any obvious redundancies. From ther i saw the code was archaicly using divs instead of the smrt div functionality. After cleaning that up, I did the samew thing in css. After cleaning up all redundant files, I re-classed all css attributes to match mock-up spec.
# -also added privacy page link pre-emptively for company.
# -please take a look and provide feedback, thank you!
