# horiseon README Notes

## Welcome to my first project! My assignment was to re-work existing code for improved SEO and accessibility using html and css. I initially skimmed through the html, looking for any obvious redundancies. From there, I saw the code was  using generic divs instead of the smrt div functionality. After cleaning that up, I did the same thing in css. After cleaning up all redundant files, I re-classed all css attributes to match mock-up spec. Also added privacy page link (currently linked back to index.html) pre-emptively for future additions

## Below are my screenshots of the webpage
